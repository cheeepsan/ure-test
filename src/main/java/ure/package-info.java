/**
 * URE is the UnRoguelike Engine, a game engine for creating roguelike games.
 *
 * URE is a class library of smart classes which work together to create a typical roguelike game
 * environment based on 2D cell grids, turn-based action, and procedural content.  It can emulate all
 * the conventions of a normal singleplayer roguelike RPG such as Nethack, but is not limited to these
 * conventions.  Users can choose to use URE simply as a display layer, or as a full world abstraction
 * manager.
 *
 * URE provides base classes such as Thing, Actor and Terrain with custom subclasses to implement
 * common behaviors of types of entities found in games.  However, the base classes can still be extended
 * without losing the use of these subclasses.  For more details see the Decorator docs.
